## The Advanced Laboratory Physics Association (ALPhA)

{{% resource_link "e5c29ba5-1f54-47bd-bc3a-909fe78ef951" "The Advanced Laboratory Physics Association (ALPhA)" %}} was formed in 2007 to provide communication and interaction among the faculty and staff who are involved in advanced laboratory physics instruction at colleges and universities in the United States and the rest of the world.

ALPhAâ€™s mission is to support and enhance advanced experimental physics education. It does so by holding special conferences and workshops on advanced experimental instruction, planning dedicated sessions at national AAPT and APS meetings, generating funding, awarding professional prizes, and facilitating communication among advanced laboratory instructors, professional organizations, and industry.
