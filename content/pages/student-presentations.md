Final Public Oral Presentations by _8.13 Experimental Physics I_ Students
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the fall term, _8.13 Experimental Physics I_ students give a 15-minute public oral presentation that is attended by all students in their section and any other interested parties. The public oral presentations are given in the style of a paper presented at a conference, with careful attention paid to the preparation of visual aids — in the form of an electronic presentation — and to the clarity of the oral discussion. Questions from classmates and the audience are encouraged, allowing for a general discussion of the experiment.
