Required Readings
-----------------

Bevington, Philip R., and D. Keith Robinson. _Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences_. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003. ISBN: 9780072472271.

_Experimental Lab Manuals_ by the Junior Lab staff (available inside every Experiment page)

_{{% resource_link 6c3edbd8-8f2c-3782-ac65-107cfbe910a2 "Ethics in Science and Education" %}}_ by the Junior Lab staff 

_{{% resource_link 29d99fa0-479e-dbce-b118-6e508eb8b5a3 "Laboratory Safety and Regulations in Junior Lab" %}}_ by the Junior Lab staff 

Recommended Texts
-----------------

Melissinos, Adrian Constantin. _Experiments in Modern Physics_. New York: Academic Press, 1966. (Out of print. May be available in academic libraries.)

Melissinos, Adrian Constantin, and Jim Napolitano. _Experiments in Modern Physics_. San Diego: Academic Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780124898516.

Consult both before and during your investigations. This text is only “Recommended” because the Junior Lab staff feels it is too expensive to “Require.” Material which is essential to the understanding of an experiment and which can be found in the Melissinos text is generally omitted from the lab manuals. The Physics Reading Room on campus has both editions which offer different material: you should consult them both!

Other Useful Texts
------------------

Preston, Daryl, and Eric Dietz. _The Art of Experimental Physics_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1991. ISBN: 9780471847489.

Taylor, John Robert. _An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements_. Sausalito, CA: University Science Books, 1997. ISBN: 9780935702750. (This book covers much of the same material as Bevington and Robinson and is easier to read.)

Gregory, Philip Christopher. _Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences: A Comparative Approach with Mathematica{{< sup "®" >}} Support_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780521841504.

Reference Articles and Equipment Manuals
----------------------------------------

At this stage of your training as an experimentalist, you should realize that there is no ‘comprehensive’ or perfect textbook. Much of the material you will need to dig into are the early journal papers which originally detailed many of these important discoveries.
